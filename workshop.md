# Create Your First dApp on Gno.land: Build Your Home Realm

✔️ Create and personalize your own Home Realm on Gno.land  
✔️ Deploy a simple decentralized application (dApp)  
✔️ Learn to interact with and test your realm    
✔️ Publish your realm in the Hall of Realms  

## Introduction

In this session, you’ll learn how to build your own Home Realm — a personalized, on-chain space that reflects your creativity and personality. You will deploy a simple dApp, explore core concepts of the Gno.land ecosystem, and learn how to test, publish, and share your realm with the wider community.

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a functioning realm deployed and the knowledge to continue experimenting and building on Gno.land.

## Step 0 - Prerequisites & Setup

### 📑 Description:

Before diving into realm creation, we need to ensure your development environment is properly configured for Gno.land development.

- **Introduction: What is Gno.land?**
    
    Brief overview
    
- **Installation & Environment Setup**
    
    *Share video link: “How to install and set up your GnoLand environment”*
    
    → basic setup, tools, and testing environment: Create a keypair, faucet on portal loop, gnodev

## Step 1 - What is a Home Realm + objectives?

### 📑 Description:

Understanding the concept of Home Realms is crucial before we start building. Let's explore what they are and what we'll accomplish in this workshop.

- **What is a Realm?**
    
    Explain the concept: a Home Realm is your personal decentralized space on Gno.land, etc…

- **What is a Home Realm?**

- **Objectives of the workshop/video:**
    - Create et personalize your own Home Realm
    - Deploy a simple dApp (your realm)
    - Learn to interact with it and test it
- **Examples & Inspirations:**
    
    → Show examples of some realms
    
    → Show the *Hall of Realms* with a variety of realms and their features/games to inspire
    
> 💡 **Inspiration Tip**: Think about what makes you unique. Your realm should reflect your personality, interests, or just you having fun.
    
### 📚 Documentation:
- [Understanding Gno Packages](https://docs.gno.land/resources/gno-packages)

## Step 2 - Live coding: Build Your First Realm

- Create the architecture of the project
- Start coding a basic realm
- Introduce basic concepts and code structure
- Show how to make transactions using **adena** and **gnokey**
- Demonstrate how to use ```std.CurrentRealm().Address()```
- Write simple logic: e.g., a basic welcome message or vote

### 📚 Documentation:
- [Standard Libraries](https://docs.gno.land/resources/gno-stdlibs)

## Step 3 - Testing your realm

- Show how to test the dApp

### 📚 Documentation:
- [Running & testing Gno code](https://docs.gno.land/resources/gno-testing)

## Step 4 - Go Further: Explore More Packages & Fun with Games

- Show additional useful packages for realms
- Talk about Gno digest to stay up to date on new packages
- Show how to implem a simple game mechanics into your realm
- Suggest fun ideas/games they can build next

## Step 5 - Save Your Realm in the Hall of Realms (HOR)

### 📑 Description:

Let's deploy your realm to Gno.land and register it in the Hall of Realms so the entire community can discover and interact with your creation.

- Explain and guide during the process of publishing your realm (using gnokey first)

### 📚 Documentation:
- [Deploying Gno Packages](https://docs.gno.land/builders/deploy-packages)

## Step 6 - Conclusion & Wrap-Up

Congratulations on coding your first Gno.land realm! Let's consolidate your learning and set you up for continued success in the Gno.land ecosystem.

- Best practices for building
- Recap key learnings
- Encourage to experiment and share the realms

### 🌟 Don't forget to share your realm with the community and inspire the next generation of builders!
